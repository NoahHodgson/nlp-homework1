## The data I chose:
The data selection I chose to use is the plain text for lord of the ring's description on its wikipedia page and compare it to 7 reviews I found online from https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33.The_Lord_of_the_Rings and here https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=lord+of+the+rings+book+review.

## Comparing and contrasting the corpa:
The biggest difference between the reviews and the wiki is the use of "I" in the reviews. The wiki does not use the first person, but reviews use it frequently. In general the words of the reviews have fewer syllables. Often the reviews use "is" for a verb. Words like "of", "the", "and", and "a" appear frequently in both. This makes sense as the phrase "Lord of the Rings" is said a lot in both, and "a" is a really common word. As far as the bigrams go, there's a good amount of similarity. As you go further down the list of the most common bigrams, I noticed that the wiki is focused on the characters, where in the reviews' popular bigrams there is not characters mentioned instead "I" and "it" are featured heavily instead.
